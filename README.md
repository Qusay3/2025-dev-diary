# 2025 Dev Diary

Welcome to my **2025 Dev Diary**! This is a year-long coding journey where I will be practicing Python and C++ and committing daily to GitHub. I'll be documenting my progress, challenges, and growth through code and reflections.

## Goals:
- Practice Python from basic to advanced topics.
- Practice C++ from basic syntax to advanced features.
- Complete coding challenges daily.
- Build interesting projects and contribute to open source.

## Structure:
- **python/**: Python-related projects and exercises.
- **cpp/**: C++-related projects and exercises.
- **projects/**: Mixed Python and C++ projects.

## Starting Today:
This repo will evolve over time with more structure, challenges, and projects added as I learn and grow in 2025. Let's get started!
